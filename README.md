I graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Independent Studies and then started and ran a successful small business for a decade. I'm currently in the Summer 2024 batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). 
 
Currently learning:

Currently working on:  
[soapnotescribe](https://github.com/josephrmartinez/soapnotescribe) - Web app that uses AI to streamline clinical charting for healthcare professionals.  
[mktute](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mktute) - CLI tool for generating markdown tutorials based on recent git diffs.
