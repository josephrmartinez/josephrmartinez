## Hi, I'm Joseph ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Independent Studies and then started and ran a successful small business for a decade. I recently completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I worked on:  
[soapnotescribe](https://github.com/josephrmartinez/soapnotescribe) - Web app that uses AI to streamline clinical charting for healthcare professionals.  
[advocate.ai](https://github.com/josephrmartinez/advocate.ai) - Web app that helps patients prepare for, record, and review their medical appointments.  

I'm now working as a full stack software engineer at [PredictionHealth](https://www.predictionhealth.com/)

Let's talk about: LLM use-cases, AI in the application layer, building delightful software
